# Problem 1 

We will first read and clean the CSV data set containing the NYC Transit data. To do so, we will first load in the `tidyverse` package that contains the necessary functions. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
transit_data = read_csv(file = "./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
transit_data = janitor::clean_names(transit_data)
```
