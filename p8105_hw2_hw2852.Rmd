# Problem 1 

We will first read and clean the CSV data set containing the NYC Transit data. To do so, we will first load in the `tidyverse` package that contains the necessary functions. We will also retain the following columns using the `select` function: 

* Line
* Station
* Name
* Station Latitude
* Station Longitude
* Routes Served
* Entry
* Vending
* Entrance Type
* ADA Compliance

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
transit_data = 
  read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names(.) %>% 
  select(., line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
  
```
